Any special instructions: 

     - All programs are written in Python.
     - Proper function modularity has been maintained wherever required.
     - Edge cases such as negative numbers, zero division, and invalid inputs were handled.
     - Menu-driven programs were implemented using loops.
     - Meaningful variable names were used instead of generic names like a and b.
     - Efficient approaches were used (e.g., square root optimization for prime check, Euclidean algorithm for GCD).
Challenges faced:

     1. Handling multiple edge cases in mathematical functions (especially Armstrong, Perfect Number, and Prime).
     2. Designing large modular programs without repetition of logic.
     3. Managing menu-driven programs cleanly without making the code messy.
     4. Ensuring correct string processing in text analysis (case handling and frequency count).
     5. Maintaining readability while implementing multiple functions in a single system.
